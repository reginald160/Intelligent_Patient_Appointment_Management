# LLM Fine-Tuning Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter notebook is designed for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) using popular libraries such as `Transformers`, `Accelerate`, and `Datasets`. The fine-tuning process utilizes a pre-trained LLM, such as GPT, and adapts it to a custom dataset for specific tasks like text generation, classification, or summarization.

## Features

- Utilizes popular libraries: `Transformers`, `Accelerate`, and `Datasets`
- Supports fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs (e.g., GPT)
- Adaptable for various tasks:
  - Text generation
  - Classification
  - Summarization

## Requirements

Due to the size and computational requirements of the model weights, it's recommended to run this notebook on **Google Colab** for access to powerful GPUs/TPUs. This ensures:

- Faster training
- Reduced local resource strain

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook.
3. Adjust hyperparameters and dataset as needed for your specific use case.

## Note

Make sure you have sufficient GPU quota on Google Colab for optimal performance during the fine-tuning process.
